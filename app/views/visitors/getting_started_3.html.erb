  <p> Yes, we know, there is a fair amount of terminology here, and it can be a bit confusing at first. Here's a short
    description of the terms you need to know.</p>
  <p><strong><%= link_to 'Course:', course_info_path %></strong> The physical course on which your event is run, ridden,
    swum (swam?), flown, or climbed.</p>
  <p><strong><%= link_to 'Split:', split_info_path %></strong> A distance from the start of a Course at which a Split
    Time
    is recorded, including optional elevation, latitude, and longitude.</p>
  <p><strong><%= link_to 'Event:', event_info_path %></strong> A single running of a race, ride, stage, or other...you
    know, event.</p>
  <p><strong><%= link_to 'Organization:', organization_info_path %></strong> The organization for grouping recurring or
    related
    Events. Even for non-organized events, this is the way you (as the Organization creator) can invite others to help.
  </p>
  <p><strong><%= link_to 'Person:', person_info_path %></strong> A person who has competed in at least one
    Event.</p>
  <p><strong><%= link_to 'Effort:', effort_info_path %></strong> The performance by a Person in a single Event.</p>
  <p><strong><%= link_to 'Split Time:', split_time_info_path %></strong> A single time at which a Person during an
    Effort passed through a given Split.</p>
  <p>All this data is stored in a logical way with proper relations, which makes it possible to do just about
    anything you want with it. If you've never seen endurance event data stored like this before, that's because
    nobody has gone to the trouble of doing it right before. Some geeky people gave this a lot of thought.
    Trust us, it all works out.</p>
