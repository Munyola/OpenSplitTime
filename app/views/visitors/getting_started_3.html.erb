  <h4>
    Duplicating an existing Event Group
  </h4>
  <br/>
  <p>If you want to create a new Event Group based on an Event Group that already exists in OpenSplitTime (for example,
    from a prior year), you can easily duplicate an Event Group. </p>
  <p> 1. Make sure you are logged in and have owner privileges for your Organization. </p>
  <p> 2. Go to <strong>My Stuff > My Organizations</strong>, then click on your Organization and click on the Event Group. </p>
  <p> 3. Click on <strong>Admin > Settings > Group Actions > Duplicate group</strong>. </p>
  <p> 4. Enter the name and date for the new Event Group and click "Duplicate Event Group". </p>
  <p>OpenSplitTime will duplicate the Event Group and all Events within the original Event Group, but will not add any
    Entrants. </p>
  <p> 5. Make any changes as necessary. For example, if the start time for your 100K was 6:00 last year but you've moved
    it to 5:30 this year, you can click Admin > Settings, and then Actions > Edit event.</p>
  <p> 6. Now <%= link_to 'import your Entrants', getting_started_6_path %> and you are ready to go.</p>
