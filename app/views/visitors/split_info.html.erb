  <h3>Splits</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>
    You need a Split anywhere you want to record times. A course comes ready-made with a start and finish split. For
    events where just finish times will be recorded, that's all you need. If you want to record times in between, you
    can
    add intermediate splits. On an ultramarathon course, these would be your aid stations. For a non-organized solo
    effort, these would be meaningful places where you measure your progress. For road races they could be mile or
    kilometer markers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Splits always have a fixed distance from the start of a Course. If you plan to record more than one time at a
    single location (for example, "in" and "out" times at an aid station or transition),
    create two intermediate points, set them at the same distance, and designate them as "in" or "out."

    Splits may include elevation/latitude/longitude data manually entered or chosen with the help of a map.
