    Formatting your spreadsheet for import

  <p>
    OpenSplitTime makes it easy (ok, at least reasonably doable for mere mortals) to import your data into the system.
    To
    start, you'll need to get your data into either Excel format (.xls or .xlsx) or comma-separated (.csv) format. Data
    is
    imported in two
    steps: Split import and Effort import.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Split import</strong></p>
  <p>
    Make sure you have a single header row containing the names of your columns. Columns related to your
    participants' personal information must be on the left starting in column A. Splits and time data must be to the
    right.
  </p>
  <p>
    OST detects the separation point by looking for a column named "Start". All columns to the left of the "Start"
    column are assumed to contain personal information field names in the header and data below. The "Start" column and
    all columns to the right of it are assumed to contain Split names in the header and Split Time data below. If no
    "Start" column is found, OST assumes that there are no intermediate splits and uses only the rightmost column for
    finish times.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every Split must have a distance from start before it can be saved to the database. To make automated import
    possible, you will need to insert a second header row immediately below your first header row. This second row must
    contain the word "distance" in the first cell (cell A2 for Excel users) and must contain split distances from start
    immediately below the split names. If distances are in units other than miles, you will need to indicate the units
    in
    the second cell of your second header row (cell B2 for Excel users). OST understands "kilometers," "km," and
    "meters."
