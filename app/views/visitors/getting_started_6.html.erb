    Formatting your Entrant data for import
  </h4><br/>
  <p>
    Once your Splits are in place, it's time to get the Entrant data in.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Entrant import</strong></p>
  <p>
    Again, the first step is to download a template, which you can do from Admin > Staging > Entrants > Import >
    Download template. Required fields are First Name, Last Name, and Gender. But please add as much information as you
    have about your entrants, as this will help OpenSplitTime match up your entrants with existing entrants in the
    database. In particular, age/birthdate and city/state are helpful in this respect.

    If you are importing Entrant data without times (for example, if this is a new event that has not yet started),
    simply complete the template, save it as a CSV file, and import it using Admin > Staging > Entrants > Import >
    Without Times.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Entrant import (with times)</strong></p>
  <p>
    If the event is already complete, you will probably want to import time data along with your entrants. To the right
    of your personal information columns you will need to have exactly as many Split
    columns as you have Splits associated with your effort. OST will reject an import if it detects a mismatch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sign in, click around, and play with the various screens and buttons. Add some things manually and import some data.
    If you get hopelessly lost and make a mess, just delete your Event, and all Efforts and Split Times related to the
    Event will be deleted with it. You cannot, accidentally or otherwise, delete any data that you did not create
    yourself.
