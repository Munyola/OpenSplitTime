  <h3>Events</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>
    An Event is just that--a single event run on a single Course, with one Effort for each person participating in the
    event.
    If you have groups running different Courses (even if they are happening at the same time), you'll need to have an
    Event for each Course. For example, the Tough Trail 50K and the Tough Trail 100K would be two separate Events, even
    if both are run at the same time and even if parts of one Course may overlap with parts of the other Course.
