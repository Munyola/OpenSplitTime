    <p><strong><%= link_to 'Raw Time:', getting_started_path(topic: :terminology, page: 8) %></strong> A single time at which a bib number is recorded
      live at a given Split while an Event is ongoing. Raw Times are viewable by Organization personnel and stewards, but
      <strong>not by the general public</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong><%= link_to 'Split Time:', getting_started_path(topic: :terminology, page: 9) %></strong> A <strong>publicly viewable</strong> time at
      which an Entrant is deemed to have been recorded at a given Split. When Raw Time records are available, as is the
      case when times are recorded live using OST Remote, Split Times will ideally represent the best possible
      interpretation of the complete Raw Time record.</p>
