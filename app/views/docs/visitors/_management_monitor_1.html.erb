    <p>OpenSplitTime provides you with advanced tools to monitor your Entrants on the course.</p>
    <p>Many race directors and timing coordinators will rotate through the various tools on a regular schedule, allowing
      them to prompt stations for timing data, provide information to stations as to when Entrants should be
      expected, and flag overdue Entrants that may be injured, exhausted, or lost.</p>
    <p>The primary monitoring tools available are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full Results view (<strong>Results > Full</strong>)</li>
